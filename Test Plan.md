# Test Plan for Album Creation, Release, and Storage Workflow

## Overview
This test plan outlines the testing approach for the **Capture**, **Release**, **Storage**, and **Delivery** applications that form the album creation, release, and storage workflow. It aims to ensure that the system meets functional and non-functional requirements, providing a seamless experience for users.

---

## Objectives
- Verify that all applications function as intended across their core functionalities.
- Ensure that data is consistently passed between the applications (Capture → Release → Storage → Delivery).
- Test system behavior for both typical and edge cases.
- Validate security and access control measures for sensitive data.
- Ensure compliance with the required metadata standards and DRM protections.

---

## Scope of Testing
### In Scope:
- Functional testing of each application (Capture, Release, Storage, Delivery).
- Integration testing between the applications.
- UI and usability testing for the user interfaces.
- Data validation (album data, metadata, artist info, etc.).
- Security testing (access controls, DRM).
- Performance testing under normal and peak loads.

### Out of Scope:
- Performance testing on hardware infrastructure (e.g., server load tests).
- Advanced usability studies or user experience (UX) testing.
- Testing of third-party distribution channels (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) beyond integration points.

## Test Strategy

### Testing Levels:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test individual components and functions of each application to verify that they work correctly in isolation.
   
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the interaction between applications, ensuring that data is transferred smoothly from one to another (e.g., from Capture to Release, from Release to Storage).
   
3. **System Testing**:
   - Test the entire workflow end-to-end (Capture → Release → Storage → Delivery) to ensure the overall system functions as intended.

4. **Acceptance Testing**:
   - Verify that the system meets the specified requirements and is ready for production release.
   
5. **Security Testing**:
   - Test role-based access controls, DRM, and data protection mechanisms.

6. **Regression Testing**:
   - After any code changes or updates, verify that no existing functionality has been broken.


## Test Deliverables
- **Test Case Results**: Documented results for each test case.
- **Defect Reports**: Detailed reports of any defects found during testing.
- **Test Summary Report**: A summary of the testing process, including pass/fail rates and any critical issues.

---

## Testing Tools
- **Test Management Tools**: JIRA, 
- **Bug Tracking**: JIRA

---

## Test Environment
- **Hardware**: Test on various devices (Desktop, Mobile) for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Software**: Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), Operating System (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Database**: MySQL (for testing the backend storage)

---

## Conclusion
This test plan outlines the key testing approaches for ensuring that the album creation, release, storage, and delivery system functions as expected. It covers functional, integration, security, and performance testing to ensure the system meets its objectives and is ready for deployment.
