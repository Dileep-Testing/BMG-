# Album Creation, Release, and Storage Workflow

## Overview
This project encompasses the full lifecycle of an album's journey from creation to release, storage, and delivery. The system is divided into four core applications that handle the various stages of an album's lifecycle: **Capture**, **Release**, **Storage**, and **Delivery**.

## Capture Application

### Background:
The **Capture Application** is responsible for the initial creation and management of album data, including artist profiles, album metadata, and track information. This application allows users (artists, producers, label executives) to input and manage all key details before the album moves to the release phase.

### Core Functionality:
- **Artist Management**:  
  - Create and manage artist profiles, including artist biography, image, and associated albums.
  - Associate albums with one or more artists.
  - Track artist royalties and contracts for payment and legal purposes.

- **Album Creation**:  
  - Enter album title, release year, genre, and other basic album details.
  - Upload album artwork and create the tracklist (titles, durations).
  - Associate album with the appropriate artist(s) for easy tracking and data linkage.

- **Sound Labeling**:  
  - Tag each track with relevant metadata, such as genre, mood, tempo, or other unique identifiers.
  - Use automated tagging tools or manual labeling for accuracy.

- **Metadata Management**:  
  - Ensure consistent and accurate tagging of metadata, including album title, artist, release year, and other information.
  - Support multiple metadata standards like ID3 or IPTC for compatibility across different platforms.

## Storage Application

### Background:
The **Storage Application** is responsible for securely storing and archiving all album-related assets (audio files, artwork, metadata) and ensuring the integrity of this data for long-term preservation. It is also responsible for managing digital rights and ensuring compliance with licensing requirements.

### Core Functionality:
- **Centralized Storage**:  
  - Store all album-related assets (audio files, artwork, metadata) in a secure, centralized location.
  - Implement version control to track revisions of album assets over time.

- **Metadata Management**:  
  - Ensure all data is tagged consistently and accurately with metadata.
  - Enable efficient search and retrieval of data across platforms and systems.

- **Digital Rights Management (DRM)**:  
  - Protect copyrighted material using DRM technologies to prevent unauthorized distribution.
  - Manage access control for album content based on licensing and distribution agreements.

- **Archiving**:  
  - Implement long-term archiving strategies for storing albums and associated assets.
  - Archive historical data for legal compliance, preservation, and future access.

## Delivery Application

### Background:
The **Delivery Application** ensures that the album reaches its intended platforms, including digital stores, streaming services, and physical distribution channels. This application coordinates the logistics of album delivery and tracks the status of these deliveries.

### Core Functionality:
- **Distribution Management**:  
  - Distribute the album to various digital, physical, and streaming platforms (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, record stores).
  - Coordinate with third-party distributors to ensure timely and accurate distribution.

- **Logistics and Tracking**:
